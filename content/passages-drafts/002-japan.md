In 1992 Michael Crichton wrote _Rising Sun_. At the time
Japan was seeing a meteoric rise, moving from a post-war
reconstruction project towards becoming the most powerful
economic engine in the world. America may have been the
progenitor of TV, cars, VCRs, record players, and denim, it
was seeing its domestic market flooded with goods from
Japan that weren't just cheaper, but superior in every way
that mattered. America was feeling an existential
insecurity of its own position in the world similar to the
one that China elicits in it today.

_Rising Sun_ is premised on the murder of a young lady at
the grand opening of a new Japanese skyscraper in Los
Angeles, and follows the responding detective as he works
his way through the corporate machinations that surround
it. An excerpt:

At the peak of Japan's run it was said that the property
under the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was worth more than the
entire state of California, but a collapsing asset bubble
in the early 90s left the country's economy stagnating for
twenty years (its so-called ["Lost Decades"][lostdecades]).
This makes the book a little dated with today's 20-20
insight into the past.

Even so, while Crichton engages in a little hyperbole for
dramatic effect, what he's stated is still more accurate
than not. Everyone's heard that all Japanese trains are on
time, but outside of Japan you assume that it's an
exaggeration. You won't know until you visit that it's
literally true -- it's not that most trains are on time,
it's that (right up to a miniscule margin of error), _all_
trains are on time, _all the time_. Transportation
infrastructure like rail isn't a little better than what
you find the US, it's two to three orders of magnitude
better.

Everyone in Japan from Shinkansen conductors, to store
clerks, to pop stars, and CEOs practices their professional
with an edged seriousness that's remarkable to see in
action. Everyone is willing to help and everything gets
done quickly and efficiently. We left one Tokyo bar only to
realize that the owner had followed us into the hallway. As
we got into the elevator and punched in our floor, she
bowed deeply as we waited for the doors to close and stayed
bowed right up until the moment when they'd hidden her from
sight.

In case it's not obvious by now, I recently had the chance
to visit Japan -- and loved it. This one turned out to be a
little long for a single edition so I've split it into two,
and I'll send the second part in early 2018. As usual, you

## A world of wonders (#wonders)

Let's start with a few facts about Japan that I think every
westerner (who's never visited) will find surprising:

* Many people have heard the urban legend that if you lose
  your wallet or purse in Japan, it will be returned to
  you. It's not a myth -- even after spending just a few
  weeks there I met a fellow in Osaka who'd forgotten his
  wallet on the train. JR found it and mailed it to his
  hotel. They even called beforehand to make sure it was
  okay to open it and remove a few hundred yen in bills to
  pay for postage.
* Convenience stores (largely 7-11, Family Mart, and
  Lawson) are a cornerstone of the country's society.
  Unlike almost anywhere else on Earth, they're ubiquitous
  (even in rural areas) and serve food that's high quality
  and healthy.
* There are vending machines everywhere and they dispense
  everything from hot drinks to fried food. They're priced
  on par with local convenience stores so people actually
  use them. Tommy Lee Jones, a figurehead for Suntory's
  Boss brand, is depicted on many of them (see below).

* There are almost no public trash cans anywhere in the
  country. If you have something to throw away, you'll need
  to pack it out until you get home or find a convenience
  store. Even despite this, Japanese cities are the
  cleanest places you'll ever see -- you'd be hard pressed
  to find a piece of litter anywhere because everyone
  follows the rules.
* Corndogs are called "American dogs" and sold at every
  convenience store. They're _delicious_ and have taken a
  spot as one of my favorite foods.
* Train conductors motion a lot with their hands as they're
  driving, even when they're by themselves. This is called
  [pointing and calling][pointcall] and in studies has
  shown to reduce mistakes by about 85%.
* Every taxi in the country has a robotic passenger door
  that can be opened at the push of a button by its driver.

## The iPhone X (#iphone-x)

I had doubts about the iPhone X. It's obvious to anyone
paying attention that Jony Ives' has wanted an end-to-end
display on Apple phones for years, and given their recent
track record I wouldn't put it past them to discard a good
technology (TouchID) for a bad one (FaceID) just to make
that happen.

I'm happy to say that I was wrong. iOS 11 had made my
trusty iPhone 6 painfully slow, so I upgraded. FaceID works
great -- it's not perfect, but it doesn't have anymore
problems than TouchID did (which performed very poorly if
your hands were wet or cold and didn't work at all through
gloves). It's OLED screen is beautiful. The camera can get
take some amazing shots. It's _fast_.

The removal of the home button isn't just an aesthetic win
(in that it removed the iPhone's "chin"), but one for
usability as well. Swiping up to go home is as fast as the
home button was, and swiping up and to the left to
multi-task is _faster_ than the old double-click.

## The Hauser (#hauser)

I can't stay away from cool bags. Recently I picked up
Mission Workshop's [Hauser][hauser], a weatherproof pack
that has the most striking backpack design that I've ever
seen.

Technically it's a hydration pack, but it's got enough
space to fit everything you need as long as you're willing
to travel light. The main compartment is narrow, but it'll
fit a stuffable jacket, a change of clothes, and/or a water
bottle. The back compartment is _just_ big enough to fit a
13" version of the latest generation of MacBook Pro.
There's enough side compartments for all the small tools,
power bricks, and Apple dongles that you need to have on
you.

[It's the only bag that I took with me][hauserkumano] for a
multi-day hike (albeit with nightly stops that were
sheltered) along the Kumano Kodo in Japan. At 14L it was a
bit of a stretch space-wise, but it worked.

## Taking coffee seriously (#coffee)

Get a scale. Get a Chemex.

## Around the web (#web)

If you're interested in reading a little more in-depth on
technical subjects, since the last edition of _Passages_ I
published two more articles on idempotency. [_Using Atomic
Transactions to Power an Idempotent API_][httptransactions]
talks about how to implement an idempotent API whose
correctness is guaranteed through `SERIALIZABLE`
transactions in Postgres. [_Implementing Stripe-like
Idempotency Keys in Postgres_][idempotencykeys] goes into
similar material, but covers the more difficult case where
the API has to make its own mutation by calling out across
a network to foreign services.

[_Redis Streams and the Unified Log_][redisstreams]
introduces the new streams data structure and how it can be
used to build log-based architecture in software (cheaply).
