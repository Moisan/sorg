In 19xx Michael Crichton wrote _Rising Sun_. At the time
Japan was experiencing a meteoric rise, moving from a
post-war reconstruction project to one of the most powerful
economic engines in the world. America may have been the
progenitor of TV, cars, VCRs, record players, and denim, it
was seeing its domestic market flooded with goods from
Japan that weren't just cheaper, but superior in every way
that mattered. America was feeling an existential fear of
the country similar to what it feels about China today.

_Rising Sun_ is premised on the murder of a young lady at
the grand opening of a new Japanese skyscraper in Los
Angeles, and follows the responding detective as he works
his way through the corporate machinations that surround
it. Here's an excerpt:

The book's a little dated by today's standards. At the peak
of Japan's run it was said that the property under the
Imperial Palace in Tokyo was worth more than the entire
state of California, but a collapsing asset bubble in the
early 90s left the country's economy stagnating for twenty
years (its so-called ["Lost Decades"][lostdecades]).

Even so, while Crichton engages in a little hyperbole for
dramatic effect, what he's stated is still more accurate
than not. Everyone's heard that all Japanese trains are on
time, but outside of Japan you assume that it's an
exaggeration. You won't know until you visit that it's
literally true -- it's not that most trains are on time,
it's that (right up to a miniscule margin of error), _all_
trains are on time, _all the time_. Transportation
infrastructure like rail isn't a little better than what
you find the US, it's two to three orders of magnitude
better.

Everyone in Japan from Shinkansen conductors, to store
clerks, to pop stars, and CEOs practices their professional
with an edged seriousness that's remarkable to see in
action. Everyone is willing to help and everything gets
done quickly and efficiently. We left one Tokyo bar only to
realize that the owner had followed us into the hallway. As
we got into the elevator and selected the main floor, she
bowed deeply to us as we waited for the doors to close and
right up until the moment when they'd hidden her from
sight.

In case it's not obvious by now, I recently had the chance
to visit Japan -- and loved it. This one turned out to be a
little long for a single newsletter so I've split it into
two, and I'll send the second part in early 2018. As usual,
