In 1992 Michael Crichton wrote _Rising Sun_. At the time
Japan was experiencing a meteoric rise, moving from a
post-war reconstruction project to one of the most powerful
economic engines in the world. America may have been the
progenitor of TV, cars, VCRs, record players, and denim, it
was seeing its domestic market flooded with goods from
Japan that weren't just cheaper, but superior in every way
that mattered. America was feeling an existential fear of
the country similar to what it feels about China today.

_Rising Sun_ is premised on the murder of a young lady at
the grand opening of a new Japanese skyscraper in Los
Angeles, and follows the responding detective as he works
his way through the corporate machinations that surround
it. Here's an excerpt:

The book's a little dated by today's standards. At the peak
of Japan's run it was said that the property under the
Imperial Palace in Tokyo was worth more than the entire
state of California, but a collapsing asset bubble in the
early 90s left the country's economy stagnating for twenty
years (its so-called ["Lost Decades"][lostdecades]).

Even so, while Crichton engages in a little hyperbole for
dramatic effect, what he's stated is still more accurate
than not. Everyone's heard that all Japanese trains are on
time, but outside of Japan you assume that it's an
exaggeration. You won't know until you visit that it's
literally true -- it's not that most trains are on time,
it's that (right up to a miniscule margin of error), _all_
trains are on time, _all the time_. Transportation
infrastructure like rail isn't a little better than what
you find the US, it's two to three orders of magnitude
better.

Everyone in Japan from Shinkansen conductors, to store
clerks, to pop stars, and CEOs practices their professional
with an edged seriousness that's remarkable to see in
action. Everyone is willing to help and everything gets
done quickly and efficiently. We left one Tokyo bar only to
realize that the owner had followed us into the hallway. As
we got into the elevator and selected the main floor, she
bowed deeply to us as we waited for the doors to close and
stayed bowed right up until the moment when they'd hidden
her from sight.

In case it's not obvious by now, I recently had the chance
to visit Japan -- and loved it. This one turned out to be a
little long for a single edition so I've split it into two,
and I'll send the second part in early 2018. As usual, you

## A world of wonders (#wonders)

Let's start with a few facts about Japan that I think every
westerner who has never visited will find surprising:

* Many people of heard the urban legend that if you lose
  your wallet or purse in Japan, it will be returned to
  you. It's not a myth -- even after spending just a few
  weeks there I met a fellow in Osaka who'd forgotten his
  wallet on the train. JR found it and mailed it to his
  hotel. They even called beforehand to make sure it was
  okay to open it and remove a few hundred yen in bills to
  pay for postage.
* Convenience stores (largely 7/11, Family Mart, and
  Lawson) are a cornerstone of the country's society.
  Unlike almost anywhere else on Earth, they're ubiquitous
  (even in rural areas) and serve food that's high quality
  and healthy.
* There are vending machines everywhere and they dispense
  everything from hot drinks to fried food. They're priced
  on par with local convenience stores so people actually
  use them. Tommy Lee Jones, a figurehead for Suntory's
  Boss brand, is depicted on many of them (see below).

* There are almost no public trash cans anywhere in Japan.
  If you have something to throw away, you'll need to pack
  it out until you get home or find a convenience store.
  Even despite this, Japanese cities are the cleanest
  places you'll ever see -- you'd be hard pressed to find a
  piece of litter anywhere because everyone follows the
  rules.
* Corndogs are called "American dogs" and sold at every
  convenience store. They're _delicious_ and have taken a
  spot as one of my favorite foods.
* Train conductors motion a lot with their hands as they're
  driving, even when they're by themselves. This is called
  [pointing and calling][pointcall] and in studies has
  shown to reduce mistakes by about 85%.
* Every taxi in the country has a robotic passenger door
  that can be opened at the push of a button by its driver.
