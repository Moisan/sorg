In 1992 Michael Crichton wrote _Rising Sun_. At the time
Japan was seeing a meteoric rise, moving from a post-war
reconstruction project towards becoming the most powerful
economic engine in the world. America invented TV, cars,
film, printers, and denim, but was seeing its domestic
market flooded with Japanese versions that weren't just
cheaper, but better in every way that mattered. America was
feeling an existential insecurity of its own position in
the world like the one China elicits today.

Here's an excerpt that's always stuck with me:

At the peak of Japan's dominance it was said that the
property under the Imperial Palace in Tokyo was worth more
than the entire state of California. Unfortunately, instead
of the country's economy shooting straight to the moon, a
collapsing asset bubble in the early 90s left it stagnating
for twenty years (the so-called ["Lost
Decades"][lostdecades]). With today's 20-20 insight into
the past, _Rising Sun_ feels a little dated.

Even so, I still find the passage more accurate than not.
Everyone's heard that trains in Japan are on time, but you
don't see until you visit that it's literally true. Not
only that most trains are on time, but that right up to a
miniscule margin of error, _all_ trains are on time, _all
the time_. Rail infrastructure and technology isn't a
little better than what you find the states, it's two to
three orders of magnitude better.

Everyone in Japan from Shinkansen conductors to CEOs and
store clerks to pop stars practice their professions with
disciplined seriousness. A subway kiosk goes out of service
and an attendant is flagged over and has it fixed in
minutes. You walk out of a bar and the owner follows you
into the hallway and bows low until the elevator's doors
finally hide her from sight. A train leaves the station 20
seconds early [and its operator issues a formal
apology][twentysec].

## Hello, again (#hello)

Oh yeah, I went to Japan.

For my money, it's one of the most interesting countries in
the world. I had the privilege of visiting everything from
its densest urban metropolises to its most beautiful wild
areas. This one turned out to be a little long so I've
split the edition into two, with the second part coming in
early 2018.

reading!

## Stranger than fiction (#fiction)

Let's start with a few facts about Japan that I think every
westerner (who's never visited) will find surprising:

* Many people have heard the urban legend that if you lose
  your wallet Japan, it will be returned to you. It's true.
  I first heard the story from a teacher in elementary
  school who'd left her purse on a park bench. She came
  back and retrieved it the next day. I met a guy in a bar
  in Osaka who'd forgotten his wallet on the train. JR
  found it and mailed it to his hotel. They even called
  beforehand to make sure it was okay to open it and remove
  a few hundred yen in bills to pay for postage.
* Convenience stores (largely 7-11, Family Mart, and
  Lawson) are a cornerstone of society. Unlike almost
  anywhere else on Earth, they're ubiquitous even in rural
  areas, and serve food that's quality and healthy (well,
  some of it anyway).
* There are vending machines everywhere and they dispense
  everything from hot drinks to fried food. Prices are the
  same as local convenience stores so there's no reason not
  to use them. Tommy Lee Jones, a figurehead for Suntory's
  Boss brand, is depicted on them throughout the country.

![Boss](/assets/passages/002-japan/boss@2x.jpg)

* There are no public trash cans. If you have something to
  throw away, you pack it out until you get home or come
  across a convenience store. You'd think this would lead
  to runaway littering, but Japanese cities are the
  cleanest places you'll ever see. Everyone follows the
  rules.
* Corndogs are called "American dogs" and sold at every
  convenience store along tiny condiment packets that
  dispense the perfect amount of ketchup and mustard.
  They're _delicious_ and have taken a spot as one of my
  favorite foods.
* Train conductors motion with their hands and speak as
  they're driving, even when they're alone. This is called
  [pointing and calling][pointcall] and has been shown to
  reduce mistakes by about 85%.
* Every taxi in the country has a robotic passenger door
  that can be opened at the push of a button.

## Kanazawa (#kanazawa)

Kanazawa's a city of about half a million parked on the
coast northwest of Tokyo along the Sea of Japan. After a
brief layover at Narita to board a new plane, it was our
first stop.

Kanazawa's a great place to visit because it has the beauty
and history of Japan without the density of its major
cities, which can be a little overwhelming for visitors.
Its houses were once taxed based on the width of their
street frontage, which led to the development of
picturesque streets packed with houses that are long, but
narrow.

Every few blocks you run into a shrine, most of which are
inconceivably beautiful. They're part of Japan's Shinto
religion, and it's common for the otherwise secular locals
to visit them for a quick few minuet of prayer.

![Kanazawa](/assets/passages/002-japan/kanazawa@2x.jpg)

It's a wet region, and at night we'd often find ourselves
laying back listening to thunderstorms raging outside. Like
anyone who lives with regular rain, the locals hate it. To
someone who lives in dry California, it's fantastic.

![Suzuki Museum](/assets/passages/002-japan/suzuki@2x.jpg)

### Yukitsuri (#yukitsuri)

One of Kanazawa's signature features is the Kenrokuen
Garden, considered to be one of the Three Great Gardens of
Japan along with sisters in Okayama and Mito. It has all
the hallmarks of a Japanese garden including sculpted
trees, tranquil ponds, and moss-covered stone bridges and
lanterns.

![Yuki-tsuri](/assets/passages/002-japan/yuki-tsuri-1@2x.jpg)

A common sight at Kenrokuen is "Yukitsuri", a Japanese
technique for protecting the growth of trees from heavy
snowfall. Ropes are hung to lend extra support for branches
and larger ones are propped up with bamboo columns. The
extra support keeps parts of the tree upright and growing
laterally when they'd otherwise bow under the weight of
heavy, wet snow.

Yukitsuri unlocks growth that would be impossible in
nature. It's pretty neat to look at too.

## The macaques of Nagano (#macaques)

Japan has its own species of macaque, often referred to as
a "snow monkey". With the exception of humans, no other
primate lives further north, or in colder weather.

We visited _Jigokudani Snow Monkey Park_ in Nagano, an area
well known for its wild monkeys and its natural hot
springs. During the cold winter the monkeys to flock to the
hot springs, where they relax in the warm water. (And in my
opinion, make some of the world's greatest photo models.
[Google it][macaques].)

![Macaques](/assets/passages/002-japan/macaques@2x.jpg)

The macaques don't make it to the human-accessible part of
park every day, but its wardens helpfully post daily status
updates to Facebook that read "monkeys!!" or "no monkeys
:(" so that you can get a feel for how often they visit
(they usually do).

And when they come, they come in droves. When I saw my
first macaque I crept around him carefully, afraid that I'd
scare him off. A moment I realized later that I was missing
the forest for the trees -- a little further up the path
were about two hundred others like him screaming at each
other and running in every direction, often just inches
from your feet. There are very few parks in the world where
you'll get such a wild experience this personal.

### Shibu Onsen (#shibu-onsen)

A little down the road from Jigokudani is a village called
Shibu Onsen that's an excellent embodiment of rural Japan.
_Onsen_ (♨) is the Japanese word for a natural hot spring.
Some places, like Shibu Onsen, are so intrinsically linked
to their hot springs that they have "onsen" right in the
name.

The village has a narrow main road with nine bath houses
built along it. Most of the onsens don't have reception
areas; instead there are two doors leading to the men's and
women's baths that lead right off the street. Visitors get
a master key from the _ryokan_ (a traditional Japanese inn)
they're staying at and travel up and down the street
visiting each one. Most are clothed only in _yukata_ robes,
with _geta_ sandals clacking against the stone as they
walk. It's said to be good fortune to make it to all nine
of the baths in one day.

![Shibu Onsen](/assets/passages/002-japan/shibu-onsen@2x.jpg)

We couldn't do the normal tour because we didn't have a
place to stay overnight, but we found a small ryokan that
let us in to use their onsens for a few hours. The place
looked to be about two hundred years old, but the age just
added to the character -- the history in every ancient tile
and board of wood was palpable. In some cases the mineral
formations on pipes were two inches high -- buildup caused
by years of carrying the raw yield of the Earth.

### ♨ Onsens & the art of bathing (#onsens)

The Japanese have taken advantage of their island's
volcanic nature to produce thousands of onsens based around
around the country. Onsens are just one side of the
country's public paths though -- the other is its _sentō_,
identical to their naturally occurring cousins but not
restricted by geography -- they're filled with simple
heated tap water.

Public bathing is engrained in the cultural landscape of
Japan. Beyond just a way of getting clean, it's also a way
to go relax, socialize, and if you're willing to buy into a
little bit of mythos -- heal. Onsens are often attributed
with certain healing powers based on their location and
unique mix of naturally occurring minerals.

![Onsen](/assets/passages/002-japan/onsen@2x.jpg)

A common way for locals to escape the bustle of Tokyo is to
make the short trip up to Hakone, known particularly for
traditional ryokans, colorful hues in the autumn, and of
course -- onsens. There's even a Japanese TV series about a
salaryman who hates his job and skips work to visit local
sentōs (_Sunshine Sento-Sake_; [available on
Amazon][sunshine]).

## Lucky Yebisu (#lucky-yebisu)

During one of our last days in Japan we stumbled across the
Yebisu beer museum in Tokyo's vibrant Ebisu district
(itself named for the beer company). Yebisu is named for
Ebisu, the Japanese god of fishermen and luck. He's one of
the [Seven Gods of Fortune][sevengods] that you'll find
portrayed in every corner of Japan. He's shown on bottles
of Yebisu with his fishing rod and baskets of fish.

![Lucky Yebisu](/assets/passages/002-japan/lucky-yebisu@2x.jpg)

Here's one of the most minute Easter eggs you'll ever come
across: 99%+ of Yebisu bottles look like the one on the
right. One in every few hundred looks like the bottle on
the left. Notice the difference?

If not, you're not the only one -- you practically need a
microscope to see it.

Look all the way over to the very left-hand side of the
photo and you'll see that Yebisu on the left has an extra
fish. _Both_ of his baskets are full while the Yebisu on
the right only has a fish in one of his baskets. These
special bottles are called "Lucky Yebisus" and their extra
detail is totally insignificant, and yet spread across the
world. It serves no useful purpose other than to bring a
little bit of delight into the day of one of the handful of
people who come across a Lucky Yebisu and know the trick.

## The iPhone X (#iphone-x)

I had my doubts about the iPhone X. Anyone paying attention
knows that Jony Ives has wanted an end-to-end display on
Apple phones for years, and given their recent track record
I thought they'd finally lost it on the X -- jettisoning a
good technology (TouchID) for a bad one (FaceID) just to
make the prettier screen happen.

![iPhone X](/assets/passages/002-japan/iphone-x@2x.jpg)

I was wrong. iOS 11 had made my trusty iPhone 6 painfully
slow, so I upgraded. FaceID works great -- it's not
perfect, but it has no more problems than TouchID did
(which performed very poorly if your hands were wet or cold
and didn't work at all through gloves), and that screen
_really is_ pretty. The camera takes some amazing shots.
The new chip is _fast_.

Best of all, the removal of the home button isn't just an
aesthetic win (it removed the iPhone's "chin"), but one for
usability as well. Swiping up to go home is as fast and
reliable as the home button was, and swiping up and to the
left to multi-task is _faster_ than the old double-click.
The home button was too overloaded, and the new swipe
gestures are better.

## The Hauser (#hauser)

I can't stay away from cool bags. I picked up Mission
Workshop's new [Hauser][hauser], a weatherproof pack that
has the most striking design that I've ever seen.

![The Hauser](/assets/passages/002-japan/hauser@2x.jpg)

Technically it's a hydration pack, but it's got enough
space to fit everything you need as long as you're willing
to travel light. The main compartment is narrow, but it'll
fit a stuffable jacket, change of clothes, and water
bottle. The back compartment is _just_ big enough to fit
the 13" version of the latest generation of MacBook Pro.
There's enough side compartments for all the small tools,
cards, and Apple dongles that you need to have on you.

[It's the only bag that I took with me][hauserkumano] for a
multi-day hike (albeit with nightly stops that were
sheltered) along the Kumano Kodo in Japan. At 14L it was a
bit of a stretch space-wise, but it worked.

## Taking coffee seriously (#coffee)

I've owned a [Chemex][chemex] for years, but have always
opted to eyeball my quantities -- putting roughly the right
amount of beans through the grinder, and filling the water
to where I think is right.

I recently invested in a couple new tools. The first is a
kitchen scale that I can use to get all quantities exactly
right. The second is a long-stemmed kettle with a twist: it
has a small thermometer on the top that I can use to hit
the ideal 96° C.

![Coffee](/assets/passages/002-japan/coffee@2x.jpg)

They helped me to a few realizations really fast. I hadn't
been using enough beans, I'd been adding _too much_ water,
and I'd been letting the water cool for way too long (it
turns out that boiling water left to cool on the counter
really only takes a few seconds to fall to 96).

The usability features built into a $15 kitchen scale these
days are impressive. My favorite is that it'll "tare"
(that's when its weight reading is zeroed to account for
the weight of an empty container) automatically when it's
turned on, negating the weight of whatever's already on it.
As long as there's a container on it first, it's operable
by pressing only one button one time.

Here's my Chemex recipe:

* 42g coffee ground to the consistency of Kosher salt.
* Bloom by pouring 150g of water over ~45s (water at 96°
  C).
* Finish by pouring on another 450g water for a total of
  600g.

## A few other publications (#publications)

If you're interested in reading a little more in-depth on
technical subjects, since the last edition of _Passages_ I
published two more articles on idempotency. The article
published [earlier this year on Stripe's
blog][stripeidempotency] is a decent primer. [Using atomic
transactions to power an idempotent API][httptransactions]
goes a little further to talk about how to implement an
idempotent API whose correctness is guaranteed through the
`SERIALIZABLE` isolation level in Postgres. [Implementing
Stripe-like idempotency keys in Postgres][idempotencykeys]
covers the more difficult case where the API has to make
its own mutation by calling out across a network to foreign
services.

[Redis streams and the unified log][redisstreams]
introduces the new streams data structure in Redis, and how
it can be used to build log-based architecture in software.
In many stacks streams will make a good Kafka alternative
that's easier to install and cheaper to run.

Thanks for making it this far! I hope this newsletter will
serve as your periodic reminder to get in touch -- just hit
