It's not surprising that a fiction author engages in a
little hyperbole for dramatic effect, but what _is_
surprising is that despite a little exaggeration,
everything he's written is more or less true. Everyone's
heard that trains in Japan are on time, but what you won't
know unless you visit is that it's literally true. It's not
that _most_ trains are on time, it's that right up to a
miniscule margin of error, _all_ trains are on time. _All
the time_.

Everyone in Japan from Shinkansen conductors, to store
clerks, to pop stars and CEOs takes their job seriously.
