It struck me recently that the details of many journeys are
lost. It's not that they're gone, but more that they don't
come up in conversation, and unwittingly vanish as they
become a story that's never told. Even those that do get
transferred are eventually sacrificed to our rickety
memories. Artifacts like photos remain of course, but most
of us are hopelessly bad at periodically sifting through
the thousands of photos that we've accumulated throughout
our lives.

For Christmas a few years ago, my grandmother gave me one
of the best gifts that I've ever received. She presented my
brother and I each with a book of memories. She'd hunted
through her extensive photography collection and carefully
selected a few dozen photos that in aggregate told the
stories of our lives -- from the weeks after our births, to
our early family vacations, and all the way through to
proms and first cars. Each was annotated with a few witty
words from Grandma to make them meaningful.

These volumes are special. It's easy to casually pick one
up and scan through a few pages looking at random pictures
and letters. My grandmother had found the perfect
compromise in story-telling mediums -- light enough to
skim, but substantial enough to last.

## Passages & Glass (#passages-glass)

This is what I'm trying to with _Passages & Glass_ --
short, self-indulgent stories about what I've been doing,
and on some of my favorite things in products and software.

_Passages & Glass_ is also my attempt to support the
independent web. It's sent via the only universal
communication medium that we have (email) in the most open
formats available (plain text and HTML), and is my
infinitesimally small way of pushing back against the
continued centralization of our stories in closed platforms
like Facebook and Twitter.

## Portland (#portland)

### Salt & Straw

Salt & Straw's a hipster ice cream brand known particularly
for quirky flavors like "freckled woodblock chocolate",
"avocado and strawberry sherbet", and "black olive brittle
& goat cheese". They originated in Portland and have since
spread to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Instead of waiting
in the hour-long lineup back home in their new location on
Fillmore St, we waited in the lineup in their home city --
much more reasonable at a mere 45 minutes.

Keiko seemed a little agitated during our time in line. I
assumed it was for the same reason that I was agitated,
namely that we were spending half our day waiting for ice
cream, but it turned out to be something else entirely. The
man who'd been standing directly in front of us in line had
been [Hideaki Itō][ito], a huge movie star in Japan. The
poor guy had gathered his young family and traveled across
the Pacific ocean for a little hard-won anonymity in
suburban America, only to find himself in line next to one
of the few other Japanese nationals in the city.

Keiko hadn't said anything because she wasn't 100% sure it
was him (only about 95%), which is roughly consistent to my
experience with meeting celebrities in the wild. A few
years back, Peter and I sat down for some cocktails at Milk
Tiger in Calgary. We looked next to us and just a few feet
away was [Kiefer Sutherland][kiefer], having a drink alone
at the bar. We spent the next hour debating heatedly (and
very quietly) whether or not it was him, and which _24_
quote we could use in case it was, when suddenly, and
before we could say a word, he got up, and walked out of
the bar.

I said, "I wonder if it was him." Peter replied, "You
idiot. Of course it was him."

### The city of cycling and beer (#cycling-and-beer)

Rating high on the list of things to do in Portland are
bicycling and beer. We decided to combine the two passions
by taking a tour one one of their local [party
bikes][party-bike] (also known as pedibuses, cycle pubs,
bierbikes, and megacycles). Open container laws are in
effect in Portland, so rather than drink on the bike
itself, we ranged around the downtown core and stopped at
nearby breweries and bars.

![Brewcycle](/assets/passages/001-portland/L1010517@2x.jpg)

We loaded twelve people and a driver onto the thing. I'm a
reasonable cyclist, so in my mind's eyes I imagined us
producing enough power to tear up the streets; pausing at
reds only long enough to give the neighboring driver a
sidelong look before accelerating from the stop and racing
to the next light.

Alas, I've never worked so far to move so little. Not only
were elderly citizens taking casual strolls down the street
outpacing us by a good margin, but I'm also pretty sure
that I've hit a higher top speed on the stationary bicycle
at the gym.

The good news is that the beer was good, and I'd burned
enough calories pedaling around a very heavy object to feel
only moderately bad about drinking it.

### The trail of ten falls (#ten-falls)

Before the wedding we'd done a little urban hike to see the
Stone House and the epic view of Mount Hood and downtown
Portland from the Pittock Mansion, but nothing substantial.
As luck would have it though, our friends Andrée and Simon,
who had rented a car, invited us to come along with them
for a day hike along the [Trail of Ten Falls][ten-falls] in
Silver Falls State Park (Oregon's largest state park at
over 9,000 acres).

In terms of visible natural beauty on a per mile basis,
this hike is one of the best that you'll ever find. The
falls vary wildly in size, but there are ten of them, and
the largest have a dreamy Middle-Earthian quality as they
pour from tall cliffs into tranquil mountain streams.

After the trip, we stopped off for some much needed beers
in Salem, the capital of Oregon which is located a little
southwest of Portland. This penultimate destination was
called Salem Ale Works (SAW), and our Bay Area instincts
couldn't comprehend that we were paying so little for beer
this good. Back in Portland we did one final stop at 10
Barrel Brewing before saying our goodbyes and going to pack
our bags.

## Flyknit (#flyknit)

Nike's Flyknit technology is one of my favorite products of
the last few years. I'm the type of person who's too hot 90
seconds into doing anything even remotely physical
(walking, biking, running, cleaning, etc.), and am always
on the lookout for ways to stay cooler.

Flyknit shoes are the answer for me. Their woven fabric may
not be very good for waterproofness, but they're unbeatable
when it comes to breathability. With their built-in
eclectic designs and scintillating colors, they also look
great, and I say that as someone who's never thought that
about a shoe before.

A travel trick that I've really taken to heart is to just
wear my Flyknit running shoes all the time. When I got
somewhere, I don't take any footwear beyond what I have on
my feet, and save a proportional amount of space in my
luggage. Although not appropriate for every possible
situation, they've got me covered for urban walking,
running, and short to medium length hikes.

(And I should probably point out at this point that no,
Nike did not sponsor this newsletter.)

## Go – love it and hate it (#go)

And now a brief note on software. Like my website, this
newsletter is built and sent by a custom [Go][go]
executable (I talk a little more about the [technical
details here][newsletter]). This might sound a little crazy
to a veteran engineer -- software is in a constant state of
erosion, and building custom single use software is a like
building a self-imposed personal maintenance nightmare, but
so far my results with Go have been good.

The language has a lot of problems -- a deep natural
aversion to generics and dependency management, an equally
powerful love for void pointers (`interface{}`), and a
dictator that considers syntax highlighting "juvenile" --
and yet I still find it to be pleasurable and painless to
work with. Compared to the dynamic languages (Ruby, Python,
JavaScript, etc.) I like that the code I write isn't so
prone to rot, and even compared to my other favorite right
now, [Rust][rust], it's relaxing not having to chase a
target that never seems to stop moving. The code I write
today is still best practice a year from now, and my
dependencies aren't all pinned to special compiler pragmas
and the nightly release channel.

Go has by far the best (fastest and most problem-free)
edit-compile-debug loop of any language, bar none. I'm able
to find a native library for any task that I want to
accomplish -- everything from CSS inlining to image
resizing, and it's nice not having to troubleshoot build
failures for C extensions like in Ruby. Lastly, the
language's stability is amazing. I'd bet that this project
will still compile on modern Go ten years from now. I often
say that I don't know what the right answer in technology
is, but there's no doubt that Go's a good one.
