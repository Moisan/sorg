It struck me recently that the details of many journeys are
lost. It's not that they're gone, but more that they don't
come up in conversation, and unwittingly vanish as they
become a story that's never told. Even those that do get
transferred are eventually sacrificed to our rickety
memories. Artifacts like photos remain of course, but most
of us are hopelessly bad at periodically sifting through
the thousands of photos that we've accumulated throughout
our lives.

For Christmas a few years ago, my grandmother gave me one
of the best gifts that I've ever received. She presented my
brother and I each with a book of memories. She'd hunted
through her extensive photography collection and carefully
selected a few dozen photos that in aggregate told the
stories of our lives -- from the weeks after our births, to
our early family vacations, and all the way through to
proms and first cars. Each was annotated with a few witty
words from Grandma to make them meaningful.

These volumes are special. It's easy to casually pick one
up and scan through a few pages looking at random pictures
and letters. My grandmother had found the perfect
compromise in story-telling mediums -- light enough to
skim, but substantial enough to last.

## Passages & Glass (#passages-glass)

This is what I'm trying to with _Passages & Glass_ --
short, self-indulgent stories about what I've been doing,
and on some of my favorite things in products and software.

_Passages & Glass_ is also my attempt to support the
independent web. It's sent via the only universal
communication medium that we have (email) in the most open
formats available (plain text and HTML), and is my
infinitesimally small way of pushing back against the
continued centralization of our stories in closed platforms
like Facebook and Twitter.

## Portland (#portland)

### Salt & Straw

Salt & Straw's a hipster ice cream brand known particularly
for quirky flavors like "freckled woodblock chocolate",
"avocado and strawberry sherbet", and "black olive brittle
& goat cheese". They originated in Portland and have since
spread to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Instead of waiting
in the hour-long lineup back home in their new location on
Fillmore St, we waited in the lineup in their home city --
much more reasonable at a mere 45 minutes.

Keiko seemed a little agitated throughout our time in line.
I assumed it was for the same reason that I was agitated,
namely that we were spending half our day waiting for ice
cream, but it turned out to be something else entirely. The
man who'd been standing directly in front of us in line had
been [Hideaki Itō][ito], a huge movie star in Japan. The
poor guy had gathered his young family and traveled across
the Pacific ocean for a little hard-won anonymity in
suburban America, only to find himself in line next to one
of the few other Japanese nationals in the city.

Keiko hadn't said anything because she wasn't 100% sure it
was him (only about 95%). This is roughly consistent to my
experience with meeting celebrities in the wild. A few
years back, Peter and I sat down for some cocktails at Milk
Tiger in Calgary. We looked next to us and just a few feet
away was [Kiefer Sutherland][kiefer], having a drink alone
at the bar. We spent the next hour debating heatedly (and
very quietly) whether or not it was him, and which _24_
quote we could use in case it was, when suddenly, and
before we could say a word, he got up, and walked out of
the bar.

I said, "I wonder if it was him." Peter replied, "You
idiot. Of course it was him."

### The city of cycling and beer (#cycling-and-beer)

Rating high on the list of things to do in Portland are
bicycling and beer. We decided to combine the two passions
by taking a tour one one of their local [party
bikes][party-bike] (also known as pedibuses, cycle pubs,
bierbikes, and megacycles). Open container laws are in
effect in Portland, so rather than drink on the bike
itself, we ranged around the downtown core and stopped at
nearby breweries and bars.

We loaded twelve people and a driver onto the thing. I
consider myself a reasonably strong cyclist, so in my
mind's eyes I imagined us producing enough power to tear up
the streets; pausing at reds only long enough to give the
neighboring driver a sidelong look before accelerating from
the stop and racing to the next light. Alas, I've never
worked so far to get so little. Not only was the top speed
of elderly citizens taking casual strolls down the street
significantly higher than ours, but I've also moved
stationary bicycles more quickly.

### The trail of ten falls (#ten-falls)
