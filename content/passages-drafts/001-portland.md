It struck me recently that the details of many journeys are
lost. It's not that they're gone, but more that they don't
come up in conversation, and unwittingly vanish as they
become a story that's never told. Even those that do get
transferred are eventually sacrified to our rickety
memories. Artifacts like photos remain of course, but most
of us are hopelessly bad at perodicaly sifting through the
thousands of photos that we've accumulated throughout our
lives.

For Christmas a few years ago, my grandmother gave me one
of the best gifts that I've ever received. She presented my
brother and I each with a book of memories. She'd hunted
through her extensive photography collection and carefully
selected a few dozen photos that in aggregate told the
stories of our lives -- from the weeks after our births, to
our early family vacations, and all the way through to
proms and first cars. Each was annotated with a few witty
words from Grandma to make them meaningful.

These volumes are special. It's easy to casually pick one
up and scan through a few pages looking at random pictures
and letters. My grandmother had found the perfect
compromise in story-telling mediums -- light enough to
skim, but substantial enough to last.

## Passages & Glass (#passages-glass)

This is what I'm trying to with _Passages & Glass_ --
short, self-indulgent stories about what I've been doing,
and on some of my favorite things in products and software.

_Passages & Glass_ is also my attempt to support the
independent web. It's sent via the only universal
communication medium that we have (email) in the most open
formats available (plain text and HTML), and is my small
way of pushing back against the continued centralization of
our stories in closed platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

## Portland (#portland)

### Salt & Straw

Salt & Straw's a hipster ice cream brand known particularly
for quirkly flavors like "freckled woodblock chocolate",
"avocado and strawberry sherbet", and "black olive brittle
& goat cheese". They originated in Portland and have since
spread to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Instead of waiting
in the hour-long lineup back home in their new location on
Fillmore St, we waited in the lineup in their home city --
much more reasonable at a mere 45 minutes.

Keiko seemed a little agitated throughout our time in line.
I assumed it was for the same reason that I was agitated,
namely that we were spending half our day waiting for ice
cream, but it turned out to be something else entirely. The
man who'd been standing directly in front of us in line had
been [Hideaki Itō][ito], a huge movie star in Japan. The
poor guy had gathered his young family and traveled across
the Pacific ocean for a little hard-won anonymity in
suburban America, only to find himself in line next to one
of the few other Japanese nationals in the city.

Keiko hadn't said anything because she wasn't 100% sure it
was him (only about 95%). This is roughly consistent to my
experience with meeting celebrities in the wild. A few
years back, Peter and I sat down for some cocktails at Milk
Tiger in Calgary. We looked next to us and just a few feet
away was [Kiefer Sutherland][kiefer], having a drink alone
at the bar. We spent the next hour debating heatedly (and
very quietly) whether or not it was him, and which _24_
quote we could use in case it was, when suddenly he got up,
and walked out of the bar.

I said, "I wonder if it was him." Peter replied, "You
idiot. Of course it was him."
