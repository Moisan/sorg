The details of most journeys are forgotten. It's nothing
intentional, but given enough time they stop coming up as
often in conversation, we reflect on them less, and they
disappear as sacrifices to our fickle memories. Physical
artifacts remain, but most of us are hopelessly bad at
regularly sifting through the thousands of photos and other
souvenirs that we've accumulated throughout our lives.

For Christmas a few years ago, my grandmother gave me one
of the best gifts that I've ever received. She presented my
brother and I each with a book of memories. She'd hunted
through her extensive collection of photos that she'd taken
of us growing up, and carefully selected a key few dozen
that in aggregate told the stories of our lives -- from the
weeks after our births, to early family vacations, and all
the way through to proms and first cars. Each was annotated
with a few poignant words from Grandma for flavor.

These volumes are special. It's easy to casually pick one
up and scan through a few pages looking at random pictures
and letters. My grandmother had produced the perfect
story-telling medium -- light enough to skim, substantial
enough to last.

## Passages & Glass (#passages-glass)

This is what I'm trying to with this newsletter, _Passages
& Glass_. It's a curated collection for my friends and
family of short, self-indulgent stories about what I've
been doing, and on some of my favorite things in products
and software.

![Glass](/assets/passages/001-portland/DSCF5479@2x.jpg)

_Passages_ are the routes that we use to get from one point
to another, like Hannibal's passage through the Alps,
Magellan's strait, or in the case of my far more mundane
life, my favorite walking path from Friedrichshain to
Kreuzberg. _Glass_ is the material making up the face on my
favorite products like the iPhone or Seamaster, the window
through which to watch the passing countryside by air or
rail, or the intricate optics of my camera's lens.

_Passages & Glass_ is also about supporting the independent
web. It's sent via the only universal medium of
communication that we have (email) in the most open formats
available (plain text and HTML), and is my infinitesimally
small way of pushing back against the continued
centralization and confinement of our stories in closed
platforms like Facebook and Twitter.

## Portland (#portland)

I visited Portland recently to celebrate the wedding of my
friends Sam and Blake. The first thing that you notice
about the town is how nice everyone was; I was reading a
brochure on how to use the local rail system to get from
the airport to downtown, when a MAX employee approached me
and proceeded to explain everything there was to know about
it, and help me buy a ticket. (For comparison in San
Francisco, you could stand next to a BART or Muni ticketing
machine all week, and no transit employee would notice, let
alone help.) Everywhere you go, store clerks and other
locals strike you up for conversation. While in the back of
rideshare, drivers tell meaningful stories about the area.

![Portland](/assets/passages/001-portland/L1010468@2x.jpg)

The city's beautiful. Calm and well-maintained downtown
streets spread out to become eclectic inner city suburbs
where each house has an interesting shape. Clusters of wild
shrubbery grow out front instead of the usual lawn. The
shops and sights offer an amazing variety; in the first few
days we ate at Atsuri, a ramen shop whose only other
location is in Tokyo, had espresso and Turkish delight at
the top of a double decker bus parked permanently parked
behind a row of food trucks (ToV coffee & tea), and had the
best hot wings of my life at Pok Pok.

The wedding took place outside the city in Hillsboro atop a
hill overlooking a vinyard on one side, and a golden field
of wheat on the other (later to be set ablaze by the
setting sun). The ceremony was held within a grove shaded
by a group of tall trees (which many of us wearing jackets
on the hot day were very thankful for). Will officiated,
using notes taped to the inside of a hardbound copy of
Homer's _Odyssey_. Dinner was accompanied by speeches from
the fathers of the bridge and groom, and followed by
dancing at sunset, enabled by special varieties of
margaritas and mint julips designed by the bride and groom
themselves. We were eventually handed a breakfast burrito
and loaded back onto a bus bound for our hotel. The couple
in the seat next to us had managed to smuggle a 1.75L
Costco size bottle of Bullitt bourbon on board, and it made
the ride a blur.

### Salt & Straw

Salt & Straw is a hipster ice cream brand known for quirky
flavors like "freckled woodblock chocolate", "avocado and
strawberry sherbet", and the ever-decadent "black olive
brittle & goat cheese". They originated in Portland and
have since spread to Los Angeles and San Francisco. Instead
of waiting in the hour-long lineup back home in their new
location on Fillmore St, we waited in the lineup in their
home city -- much more reasonable at a mere 45 minutes.

![Salt & Straw](/assets/passages/001-portland/L1010474@2x.jpg)

Keiko seemed a little agitated during our time in line. I
assumed this was typical ice-cream-induced anxiety, but it
turned out to be something else entirely. The man who'd
been standing directly in front of us in line had been
[Hideaki Itō][ito], a big movie star in Japan. The unlucky
fellow had gathered his young family and traveled across
the Pacific ocean for a little hard-won anonymity in
suburban America, only to find himself in line next to one
of the few other Japanese nationals in the city.

Keiko hadn't said anything because she wasn't 100% sure it
was him (only about 95%), which is roughly consistent with
my experience seeing celebrities in the wild. A few years
back, Peter and I sat down for some cocktails at Milk Tiger
in Calgary. We looked next to us and just a few feet away
was [Kiefer Sutherland][kiefer], having a drink alone at
the bar. We spent the next hour debating heatedly (and very
quietly) whether or not it was him, and which _24_ quote we
could use in case it was, when suddenly, and before we
could say a word, he got up and walked out of the bar.

I said, "I wonder if it was him." Peter replied, "You
idiot. Of course it was him."

### The city of cycling and beer (#cycling-and-beer)

Rating high on the list of things to do in Portland are
bicycling and beer. We combined the two passions by taking
a tour one one of their local [party bikes][partybike]
(also known as pedibuses, cycle pubs, bierbikes, and
megacycles). Open container laws are in effect in Portland,
so rather than drink on the bike itself, we ranged around
the downtown core and stopped at a few of its abundant
breweries and bars.

![Brewcycle](/assets/passages/001-portland/L1010517@2x.jpg)

We loaded twelve people and a driver onto the thing. I've
been known to do some long rides on occasion, and in my
mind's eye I imagined us tearing up the streets of
Portland; pausing at intersections only long enough to give
the neighboring driver a sidelong look before accelerating
on the green and racing to the next light.

Alas, I've never worked so far to move so little. Not only
were elderly citizens taking casual strolls down the street
outpacing us by wide margins, but I've hit higher top
speeds on the stationary bikes at my gym.

The good news is that the beer was good, and I'd burned
enough calories pedaling around an extremely heavy object
to feel only moderately bad about drinking it.

### The trail of ten falls (#ten-falls)

Before the wedding we'd done a little urban hike to see the
Stone House and the epic view of Mount Hood and downtown
Portland from the Pittock Mansion, but nothing substantial.
As luck would have it, our friends Andrée and Simon, who
had rented a car, invited us to come along with them for a
day hike along the [Trail of Ten Falls][tenfalls] in
Silver Falls State Park (Oregon's largest state park at
over 9,000 acres).

![Waterfall](/assets/passages/001-portland/L1010633@2x.jpg)

In terms of visible natural beauty on a per mile basis,
this hike is one of the best you'll ever find. The falls
vary wildly in size, but there are ten of them, and the
largest have a dreamy Middle-Earthian quality as they pour
from tall cliffs into tranquil mountain streams.

![Waterfall](/assets/passages/001-portland/L1010739@2x.jpg)

After the trip, we stopped off for some much needed beers
in Salem, the capital of Oregon which is located a little
southwest of Portland. This penultimate destination was
called Salem Ale Works (SAW), and our Bay Area instincts
couldn't comprehend that we were paying so little for beer
this good. Back in Portland we did one final stop at 10
Barrel Brewing before saying our goodbyes and going to pack
our bags.

## Flyknit (#flyknit)

Nike's Flyknit technology is one of my favorite products of
the last few years. I'm the type of person who's too hot 90
seconds into any kind of moving (walking, biking, running,
cleaning, etc.), and am always on the lookout for ways to
stay cooler.

Flyknit is the answer for me. Its woven fabric may not be
very good for waterproofness, but is unbeatable when it
comes to breathability. It also looks great with its
eclectic designs and scintillating colors, and I say that
as someone who's never thought that about a shoe before. I
just ordered another three pairs of Flyknit Racers because
I'm worried that I'll never find a shoe that I like this
much again.

A travel trick that I've really taken to heart is to just
wear my Flyknit shoes all the time. When I go somewhere, I
don't take any footwear beyond what I have on my feet, and
save a corresponding amount of space in my luggage.
Although not appropriate for every possible situation,
they've got me covered for urban walking, running, and all
but Alberta-length hikes.

(And I should probably point out at this point that it may
be hard to believe, but no, Nike did not sponsor this
newsletter.)

## Go – love it and hate it (#go)

And now a brief note on software. Like my website, this
newsletter is built and sent by a specially crafted
[Go][go] executable (I talk a little more about the
[technical details here][newsletter]). This might sound a
little crazy -- software is degrading starting from the
moment it's written, and building custom software is
usually a little like building a self-imposed maintenance
hell, but so far my results with Go have been good.

The language has a few problems -- a deep natural aversion
to generics and dependency management, an equally powerful
love for void pointers (`interface{}`), and a dictator that
considers syntax highlighting juvenile -- yet I still find
it to be pleasurable and painless to work with. Compared to
the dynamic languages (Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc.) I
like that the code I write isn't so prone to rot, and even
compared to my other favorite right now, [Rust][rust], it's
relaxing not having to chase a target whose syntax and core
libraries never seem to stop moving. The code I write today
is still best practice a year from now, and my dependencies
aren't all pinned to special compiler pragmas and the
nightly release channel.

Go has by far the best (fastest and most problem-free)
edit-compile-debug loop of any language, bar none. I'm able
to find a native library for any task that I want to
accomplish -- everything from CSS inlining to image
resizing, and it's nice not having to troubleshoot build
failures for C extensions like in Ruby and Python. Lastly,
the language's stability is amazing. I'd bet that this
project will still compile on the contemporary Go compiler
of ten years from now. I don't know what the best modern
tech stack is, but Go's is one of the good ones.

## On cryptocurrency (#cryptocurrency)

Bitcoin is currently one of our greatest forms of
entertainment in the valley, with plot twists so frequent
and so dramatic that not even the best writers on [Mr.
Robot][mrrobot] could have dreamt them up.

You may have heard that the preeminent digital currency
recently forked a new currency called Bitcoin Cash (see
[this article][cash] for some good background information).
Although this seems like it'll be a relatively minor fork,
starting with only around 10% of Bitcoin's total mining
power, a larger disaster was only narrowly averted.

In 2010 Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, added a 1
MB limit on Bitcoin's blocksize to protect the network from
attackers sending large fake blocks. This had the
unfortunate side effect of limiting the Bitcoin network to
seven transactions per second in theory, but with the real
number closer to 2.3 transactions. As Bitcoin's popularity
has increased, the limit has become a serious problem
because there's far more demand than capacity. Whereas
previously the fee to settle a transaction may have been
only a few cents, its since climbed to as high as $5, and
with transactions taking days to be confirmed. Small and
timely purchases are effectively impossible.

The debate on how to solve the problem has been raging
heatedly for years. Originally more radical solutions were
proposed like taking the blocksize to straight 20 MB, or
BIP101, which suggested increasing to 8MB and having it
further increase by 40% every year to keep pace with
Moore's Law. More recently, "Segwit" ("segregated witness")
was proposed, which moved signatures into a separate
extension block to leave more room for transactions and
increase the effective blocksize to 1.7 MB. Buy-in for
Segwit was low at ~35% approval with most miners preferring
a direct increase in blocksize instead. To build consensus,
Segwit was revised to Segwit2x, which still segregates
signatures, but also promised to double blocksize within
three months of release.

Right up until Segwit was turned on (August 1st), competing
ideological groups were still being formed around concepts
like a "User Activated Soft Fork" (UASF), which wanted to
implement Segwit without the blocksize increase, and a
"User Activated Hard Fork" (UAHF) which promises a hard
fork if Segwit2x reneged on their promise to double the
blocksize. It doesn't look like either will occur, but
another project that wanted to solve the capacity problem
through a straight up increase of blocksize to 8MB _did_
fork the network. That's Bitcoin Cash.

These sorts of close calls don't give everyone down here
tremendous confidence in the future of cryptocurrency. And
even Bitcoin's problems pale in comparison to alternatives
like Ethereum, which forked in 2016 after a hacker
penetrated their very libertarian named "Decentralized
Autonomous Organization" ([the DAO][dao]), and made off
with 3.6M Ether (a third of its total funds, ostensibly
worth $50M at the time). The fork reversed the theft, but
fractured the network forever.

These days I feel similarly about cryptocurrencies as my
colleague Patrick McKenzie, who I think puts it best ([when
asked][patio11] what subject he disagrees with others in
the valley on):

> I'd go with "The fundamental innovation in Bitcoin the
> social dynamics of the gold rush phase, which distribute
> cryptocurrency tokens widely for almost free. This
> creates a self-organized distributed boiler room to
> market Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs nothing else to get as big
> as it has; this is convenient because it has nothing
> else. Bitcoin has no utility as a means of transaction or
> a store of value. The blockchain is the world's worst
> database. The long line of very smart people on the other
> side of this bet have been scammed, are scamming, or
> both. Bitcoin will, accordingly, go to zero with the
> inevitability of gravity."

But with Bitcoin still trading at around $4000 USD (up
already from $2800 when I originally drafted this text!),
so far I've been wrong at every turn. Maybe these
[tulips][tulipmania] will stay in bloom forever.

## Other publications (#other)

If you can stomach a few more words by me, I've recently
published an article on [how Stripe thinks about API
versioning][apiversioning] on our engineering blog, and an
in-depth look at [how Postgres makes its transactions
atomic][atomicity] which digs into MVCC, snapshots, the
WAL, and commit log.
