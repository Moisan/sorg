## Excerpts (#excerpts)

_The Atlantic_ published a great article yesterday on
[housing activism in San Francisco][activism]. It starts
out talking about the usual line of the evil lords of tech
manifested in a kindergarten play by a particularly
enthusiastic after-school director. It goes on to point out
some of the real culprits: backwards legislation and deeply
entrenched property owners and longtime residents.

A choice quote:

> But if the musical’s director aim was to present
> oversimplified truths for the sake of social justice, the
> main antagonists shouldn’t have been evil politicians and
> tech executives—it should have been property owners
> gleefully watching the value of their biggest assets
> skyrocket as they aggressively blocked high-density
> development.

* This is a list.
* And another bullet.

1. An ordered list.
2. And another bullet too.

## Continued (#continued)

And on a more accurate version of the kindergarten play:

> The homeowners see themselves as upright
> “preservationists,” protecting the character of their
> city even as they turn it into a time-capsule for the old
> and rich. In my propaganda play, they’d be sympathetic
> with the plight of the working class, but wouldn’t value
> them nearly as much as living amidst refurbished
> Victorians. They’d prevail by tricking economically
> illiterate activists into allying with them after
> sneakily tearing the supply-and-demand chapters from
> their econ textbooks.
