> Kumano Nachi Taisha is a Shinto shrine located halfway up
> Nachi Mountain, about 350 meters above sea level. It has
> its religious origin in the ancient nature worship of
> Nachi-no-Otaki. This grand shrine is part of the Kumano
> Sanzan and major pilgrimage destination.

> Nachi-no-Otaki is 133 meters high and 13 meters wide, it
> is the tallest waterfall in Japan and can been seen from
> far out on the Pacific Ocean. Nachi-no-Otaki’s water
> source is the surrounding broad-leaf evergreen primeval
> forest. It is a sanctuary of Kumano Nachi Taisha and thus
> has been protected since ancient times and is used for
> ascetic training by mountain monks who practice Shugendo,
> a mixed religion of foreign and indigenous beliefs.

## Ponto-chō & beautiful alleys (#pontosho)

> Ponto-chō (先斗町) is a Hanamachi district in Kyoto,
> Japan, known for geiko and maiko and home to many geiko
> houses and traditional tea houses. Like Gion, Ponto-chō
> is famous for the preservation of forms of traditional
> architecture and entertainment.
>
> Ponto-chō centres around one long, narrow, cobbled alley
> running from Shijō-dōri to Sanjō-dōri, one block west of
> the Kamo River (Kamo-gawa). This is also the traditional
> location of the start of kabuki, and a statue of Okuni
> still stands on the opposite side of the river. The
> district crest is a stylized water plover or chidori.

## Wabi-sabi & aged leather (#wabisabi)

> In traditional Japanese aesthetics, Wabi-sabi (侘寂) is a
> world view centered on the acceptance of transience and
> imperfection.[2] The aesthetic is sometimes described as
> one of beauty that is "imperfect, impermanent, and
> incomplete".[3] It is a concept derived from the Buddhist
> teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印
> sanbōin), specifically impermanence (無常 mujō),
> suffering (苦 ku) and emptiness or absence of self-nature
> (空 kū).
>
> Characteristics of the wabi-sabi aesthetic include
> asymmetry, roughness, simplicity, economy, austerity,
> modesty, intimacy, and appreciation of the ingenuous
> integrity of natural objects and processes.

> A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain
> styles of Japanese pottery. In the Japanese tea ceremony,
> the pottery items used are often rustic and
> simple-looking
