hook: There's lots of bad technology out there that should
  be avoided for a modern stack. We should be talking about
  it more often.

In our industry, we have a bad tendency to hype technology
up, but never knock it down.

Over the last few decades we've seen big pushes for tools
like XML, PHP, Erlang, Node, Rails, Mongo, Riak, Go, and
countless others. More recently, the industry's seen enough
saturation that fatigue has lead to a bit more skepticism,
but we can still see the same signs of of ongoing pushes,
even if somewhat more tempered (e.g. Rust, Elixir, Crystal,
...).

Some of these tools have withstood the test of time and
proven themselves to have enough merit that they're still
fine choices for a new technology stack. On the other hand,
a good number of them are _not_ fine choices for a new
technology stack. Pathologic lack of runtime safety, a
decaying ecosystem, or a design that leads to burdenous
operation are all problems that are existential enough to
make it reasonable to make avoiding their progenitors
perfectly rational. Sometimes we make mistakes, or the
state of the art improves, and ideas that we originally
thought to be good hit the end of their useful lifetime.

It's a very human thing to do to withhold criticism. Real
people aren't only emotionally invested in technology they
use, but in many cases their livelihoods depend on it; even
honest criticism could hurt them. We have to consider the
other side though -- by being disingenuous or withholding
information on bad technology, we're cheating people and
companies who aren't using them yet, but may yet adopt
them. By speaking out, you have the potential to save
_millions_ of hours of future productivity that would have
otherwise been shoveled into the fire.

Disastrous pitfalls, vampiric operational overhead, and
chronic underdesign are never in the documentation, and
often not obvious until you're already waist deep. By being
on the inside of these things, you have access to special
insight that other people can't get without fully investing
themselves at great expense.

This isn't to say that we should unduly sling mud, but
pieces that are honest, detail-oriented, thoroughly
researched, but also critical, might be the best way that
you can help your fellow builders.
