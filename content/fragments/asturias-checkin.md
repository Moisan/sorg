I've been working on Issac Albeniz's guitar masterpiece _Asturias_ for a few
weeks now. It's been going better than expected, but it's always a little
demorizalizing after realizing that playing the first 15 measures only takes
you ~30 seconds into the song.

A few things that worked for me:

* Memorize sections. While it's certainly possible for someone to sight read
  the piece, a more amateur player can benefit a lot from removing this
  variable. _Asturias_, with its many repeating patterns and measures, is
  also particularly condusive to memorization to memorization.
* Use the guitar tablature. As far as I can tell, there is exactly one
  objectively correct way to do the song's fingering, and the guitar tab will
  save you from having to figure it out yourself (i.e. as opposed to the
  version using musical notation).

Currently giving me the most trouble is the triplet section, which starts
around [28 seconds into this John Williams rendition][triplets]. While it
sounds like _something_ when I play it, it certainly doesn't create the
beautiful "fluttering" effect that you get from a master.

Although I'm still a lot way out from a complete song, it's been a fun learning
process so far.
