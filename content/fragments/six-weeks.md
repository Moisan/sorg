Six weeks ago, I [started tracking my energy input and
output](/fragments/one-week), which I followed up [two](/fragments/two-weeks)
and [three](/fragments/three-weeks) weeks in. I'm now six weeks into the habit,
and although I have no intention of stopping the practice, I won't be writing
about it anymore because all these check-ins are starting to look alike.

Here are weeks four, five, and six:

| Day       | Food    | Exercise | Net Relative to 1,200 Cal Goal |

| Day       | Food    | Exercise | Net Relative to 1,200 Cal Goal |
| :-------: | :-----: | :------: | :----------------------------: |
| July 11   | 2,058   | 289      | +569                           |
| July 12   | 2,597   | 825      | +572                           |
| July 13   | 2,156   | 1,194    | -238                           |
| July 14   | 1,424   | 1,344    | -1,120                         |
| July 15   | 2,716   | 1,238    | +278                           |

| July 17   | 1,549   | 1,995    | -1,646                         |
| **Total** |         |          | **-1,540**                     |

Of note: many weeks I don't make targets. However, there's no question that the
tracking has had a positive effect in that I've eliminated pop, juice, energy
drinks, and unhealthy snacks (potato chips and the like) from my diet, and am
getting some kind of strenuous exercise roughly seven times a week. I'm still
drinking alcohol socially, and if I miss a calorie target, it's that practice
which is almost universally responsible. Dialing it back to a hard maximum of
two drinks in a 24 hour period [1] is a reasonable next step.

My last weigh-in this morning was 165 lbs., down from 176 lbs., which means
that I was pretty close to my goal of losing 2 lbs. per week (11 lbs. compared
to 12 lbs.).

After six weeks, I have no immediate intention of stopping food and exercise
tracking, but given that these write-ups are starting to look very alike, I
will stop making these periodic (and only very nominally interesting)
check-ins.
