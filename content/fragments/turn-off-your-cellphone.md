hook: On instant gratification, communication interrupts, and smartphones.

I've been having trouble writing lately. Even when I carve out some time to do
it, small distractions to start to creep in. Before I know it, I haven't
thought about writing in six hours and am well into my work day.

One thing I like to do when this happens is look to real authors for
inspiration. Recently I came across this interview of [Nathan Englander on the
Daily Beast][daily-beast] and found this gem:

> Turn off your cell phone. Honestly, if you want to get work done, you’ve got
> to learn to unplug. No texting, no email, no Facebook, no Instagram. Whatever
> it is you’re doing, it needs to stop while you write.

My extended periods of concentration tend to get killed by two things: (1) the
desire for instant gratification by finding a smaller/easier piece of work or
entertainment, and (2) communication interrupts. The smartphone acts as the
main delivery vector for both these things.

Now it's time to disable wi-fi and turn off my phone and
get some work done.
