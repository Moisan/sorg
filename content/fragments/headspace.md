hook: A month of meditating and reclaiming head space.
---

About a month back for an internal wellness week, Stripe
gave all of its employees a subscription to Headspace, a
meditation app for iOS.

I've been trying and failing to develop a regular practice
for well over a year now, and it's Headspace that's finally
pushed me to success. I'm now at 29 days out of the last
32; by far the best run I've ever had.

Headspace's secret is content and "light" gamification.
There are thirty 10-minute introductory sessions that
you're taken through before starting on other material.
They're are mostly the same, and purposely repetitive to
help drive the key points home, but there's just enough
progression to keep it interesting. It also tells you how
many days in a row you've meditated; a tiny prod to help
maintain your streak.

Apps that have a purely positive effect on life are few and
far between, but Headspace seems to be one of them. At
$12.95 a month, it isn't cheap, but if it helps me maintain
a 90%+ daily meditation rate for the next year, it might
just be worth it.
