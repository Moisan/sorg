hook: On locking down platforms and diluting user
  interfaces to the lowest common denominator.

Here's a great talk from Alan Kay: ["Is it Complex or Did
We Just Make it Complicated?"][talk].

There are a lot of good ideas in there, but my favorite
moment is when he sets his sights on iOS. He's asked about
running [Squeak][squeak] (a Smalltalk dialect) on the iPad,
and goes on to say:

> I'll tell you what does tick me off. Two things. The
> number one thing is that yes, you can run the Etoys

Some changes since the dawn of personal computing have been
tremendously positive, like the quantum leap in the raw
compute power or the vibrant displays and peripherals that
we now have available, but not all are as encouraging. As
suggested by Alan, the walled gardens that we take for
granted on everything from our iOS apps to our browser
extensions would have been abominable to early idealists.
So too would the idea of diluting interfaces so that
they're universally accessible, but to a point where uisng
them to be productive is hopeless.

We should be thinking about re-opening computation and
[rebooting our UX design to optimize for power
users](/interfaces). We should be using computing to push
humanity to new levels instead of constraining it to the
lowest possible baseline. There's still time to do so, but
with the continued rise in popularity of locked platforms
(iOS/Android) and the diminishing presence of the PC, the
hour grows late indeed.
