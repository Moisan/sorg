★ ★ ★ ★ ★ (out of five)

_Your Name_ is Makoto Shinkai's (_Garden of Words_; _5
Centimeters Per Second_) latest work, and particularly
notable for its domestic and worldwide success, coming in
as the 4th highest grossing movie in Japan of all time and
having already overtaken _Spirited Away_. Shinkai is
referred to as "The New Miyazaki."

In North America we had to wait almost a year for it to hit
our shores, but it was worth the wait. _Your Name_ is
delightful. It works in a healthy dose of the supernatural
while successfully relegating it to the background as
nothing more than a mechanic to advance the plot. The
movie's focus stays on the development of its two main
characters, and the story of their developing love.

The art and animation are top tier, with an incredible
attention to detail applied to every scene. It's a little
strange to recognize an iPhone 6 on screen because its
been drawn in such sharp relief. This more traditional art
form and works a lot better in so many places, and we're
all very lucky that the anime industry didn't follow in the
path of the gaming industry by embracing 3-D modeled art
exclusively.

_Your Name_ is the easiest recommendation that I've made on
this blog. It's a movie that will not only make you feel,
but feel a little better, and a little more optimistic about
life. Go see it.
