hook: 409 days of tracking all meals and exercise.

A year ago, I started [counting
calories](/fragments/calorie-counting) with the goal of
losing weight. Having just hit my 409th consecutive day,
I've kept it up far longer than I expected.

It's been a useful experience, if not a runaway success. I
initially got my weight down from 176 lbs. to 163 lbs. (by
combining diet with a lot of [Triple Peaks
runs](/stripe-running)), but have since regressed to 171
lbs., leaving me a little lighter than when I started, but
not a lot.

The habit of entering food is easy to pick up because it
lends itself so well to the moments in a day that would
otherwise be wasted, like sitting in an elevator or waiting
for someone. Unfortunately it's only half the battle, with
the other half being successfully controlling diet. During
my [first](/fragments/one-week) [couple of
weeks](/fragments/six-weeks) I was able to run pretty
frequent caloric deficits, but at some point surpluses
became more common, and eventually, normal. On an indulgent
day, I found it disturbingly easy to consume 2,000 more
kcal more than I expected to.

These days I'm trying to get that back under control by
staying close to target, but it still remains to be seen
whether my original goal is ever really successful. It's
some gain for very little effort though, so I have no plans
to stop the experiment.
