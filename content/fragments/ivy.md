hook: Stripe's new home in SOMA.
---

After years of incremental office expansions in San Francisco's Mission
district, we've got a new office (codename "Ivy") to tide us over until our
more permanent home is available next year. The space is the 4th floor (and
half of the 5th) of the "China Basin" building by the ballpark and Mission
Creek; a lease recently vacated by Dropbox as they moved to their new
headquarters.

The size of the new floor is somewhat disorienting given that the build extends
for a full "SOMA block". That might be a meaningless term if you're not
familiar with SF, but to give you an idea: previously the company was occupying
six combined floors of three separate buildings, but we can now fit all our
personnel on a single floor with room to spare.

The obvious downside of the new office is that we're now in SOMA. The upsides
were less obvious to me before we moved in, but are now clear: quick access to
the Bay, a location just minutes from some of the most peaceful green space in
San Francisco (a rare luxury in this city), and doorfront access to the best
running routes in the city [1].

One of my favorite innovations in the new space is the "quiet room"; a
soundproof area that previously functioned as Dropbox's music room, now
repurposed for distraction-free work.

I'll miss our old stomping grounds in the Mission, but these are pretty good
too.

[1] Where "best" is defined by those with the fewest lights. A route down to
Heron's Head Park is one of my new favorites.
