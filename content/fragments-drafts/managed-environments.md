For example, we distribute Puppeted laptops to every new
developer that lets them get a running start.

The problem is that because no setup was necessary, people
don't tend to understand what's going on under the hood.
When they run into a non-standard problem, they almost
always need to be bailed out by someone else because they
don't have any information on how their own environment
works.
